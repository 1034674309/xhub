# Bypass Anthropic Messages

## Native protocol and authentication

Use an XHub public model name and virtual key with the matching Bypass deployment. XHub maps the model and injects deployment credentials, preserves native fields and enforces access and billing. Bypass does not run the standard pre-call text guardrail chain. Send Authorization: Bearer $XHUB_API_KEY. Model availability depends on configured deployments. x-api-key: $XHUB_API_KEY is also accepted. Send anthropic-version: 2023-06-01. Do not send provider credentials or conflicting keys.

## Overview

## Endpoint and authentication
